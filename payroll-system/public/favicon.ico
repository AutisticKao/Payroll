The file /payroll-system/payroll-system/public/favicon.ico is typically a binary file that contains the favicon image. Since I cannot generate binary files directly, you will need to create or obtain a favicon image and save it as favicon.ico in the specified directory.

If you need a placeholder or a specific favicon, you can create a simple one using an online favicon generator or design software, and then save it in the public directory as favicon.ico.
